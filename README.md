# BYB AI Fellowship: Project Hacker Hand
Code for the Summer 2021 Backyard Brains AI Research Fellowship. 
## Google Colab Notebooks
These notebooks visualize the sEMG data and generate the datasets needed for training the TinyML model.
## Arduino Sketches
Arduino source code for the Nano 33 BLE Sense that performs 3 main tasks:
1. Read sEMG data from the SpikerShield Pro
2. Classify processed data using the TinyML model previously trained in edge impulseinferencing
3. Control the hacker hand's servomotors based on the real-time classification output
## Edge Impulse Libraries
Arduino `.zip` libraries containing the trained model generated by Edge Impulse Studio
